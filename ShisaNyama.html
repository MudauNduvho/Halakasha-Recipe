                    Place the boerwors on the grill and cook them slowly, turning occasionally to ensure even browning and prevent burning. 
                    <br>Ideally, you should braai boerwors over indirect heat, allowing the sausages to cook thoroughly while retaining their juiciness. 
                    <br>The boerwors is done when it is evenly browned and has an internal temperature of about 70°C (160°F). 
                    <br>Serve with traditional sides such as pap, chakalaka, or a fresh salad for an authentic South African experience.

                    Select a cut of steak such as ribeye, sirloin, or fillet.

            <p class="description"><b>How To Prepare</b>
                To braai pork ribs in South Africa, start by marinating the ribs in a rich mixture of spices, garlic, and your favorite BBQ sauce or marinade. 
                <br> Allow the ribs to marinate for several hours, or overnight for deeper flavor. Preheat your braai to medium heat and cook the ribs over indirect heat to prevent burning. 
                <br> Close the lid and let them slow-cook for 1.5 to 2 hours, turning occasionally and basting with additional marinade to keep them moist. For a caramelized finish, move the ribs over direct heat for a few minutes, 
                <br> brushing with extra sauce until they are beautifully glazed and crispy on the outside. 
                <br>Serve with traditional sides like braaied vegetables or a fresh salad.</p>
